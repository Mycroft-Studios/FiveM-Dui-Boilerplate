<div align="center">
This repository is a basic boilerplate for getting started
with Dui in Fivem. It contains several helpful utilities and
documents serveral parts of the Dui-making proccess

It also uses `SEND_DUI_KEY_DOWN` and `SEND_DUI_KEY_UP` for Interaction,
which are natives i made to inject key presses into the Nui Browser.

As A bonus, it streams a replace for `ex_prop_monitor_01_ex` and 
`v_ilev_cin_screen`, which have their screens upscaled from 512x256,
to 2048x1024, to give u much higher quality feel to the Dui.
